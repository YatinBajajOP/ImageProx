## Introduction 
Image processing is the process of transforming an image into a digital form and performing certain operations to get some useful information from it. The image processing system usually treats all images as 2D signals when applying certain predetermined signal processing methods. The implementation of image processing techniques has had a massive impact on many tech organizations. Here are some of the most useful benefits of image processing, regardless of the field of operation: The digital image can be made available in any desired format (improved image, X-Ray, photo negative, etc), Information can be processed and extracted from images for machine interpretation, The pixels in the image can be manipulated to any desired density and contrast and Images can be stored and retrieved easily.   

ImageProx is a one-stop solution to provide you with most of the image processing techniques you can, implement and perform operations on images. This tool can also be used as a Photo editor as well as a Data Augmentation tool which can be used as preprocessing techniques for machine learning algorithms. While the traditional photo processing tools keep the methodology of the processing abstract, but here in ImageProx the code behind the processing is displayed and is done in an interactive manner.  

## Methodology 
The research stage generates concepts and the analysis stage selects concepts and analyzes requirements and constraints. The cycle is then repeated to generate more refined concepts and these concepts are further analyzed. Our project aims to develop a user-friendly application and provide knowledge to users about digital image processing. 
Technology Stack: 
### Languages: 
●	Python: Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.  
### Frameworks/Libraries:
●	OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.     
●	Streamlit: Streamlit is an open-source python framework for building web apps for Machine Learning and Data Science. We can instantly develop web apps and deploy them easily using them. It allows you to write an app the same way you write python code. It makes it seamless to work on the interactive loop of coding and viewing results in the web app.     
## Contribution 
Learners are the central, focal point of your training program, and understanding what they expect to achieve at the end of your training program should be your main goal. ImageProx will help to bridge this gap and help the users to learn Image Processing. 

There are various photo editors which are abstract they don’t allow us to get into the code of the editing done but our platform will provide you with the implementation of the particular operation on the images. 

Data Augmentation is a technique that can be used to artificially expand the size of a training set by creating modified data from the existing one. It is a good practice to use Data Augmentation if you want to prevent overfitting, the initial dataset is too small to train on, or even if you want to squeeze better performance from your model. However, we can improve the performance of the model by augmenting the data we already have. It means that Data Augmentation is also good for enhancing the model’s performance.Our platform will also make this task easy to use as the developers can uload their data into our portal and select the functionality they want to perform and the operation would be performed and you can download the dataset. 

## Pros and Cons 
### Pros : 
●	Imageprox is portal where you can learn about Image processing 
●	It can also be used as Data Augmentation Tool 
●	It can be used as Photo editor 
### Cons : 
●	Due to heavy functionalities,if we increase the file size it may result in an increase in response time.

## Results 
In this project, a website will be developed for learning digital image processing,photo editing and Data Augmentation tools. It will include various modules and will contain theory behind functionalities,code implementation for each module to test if the concepts are cleared. It will also contain Data Augmentation functionality to get augmented data which can further be used for machine learning algorithms. Interactivity to learn concepts will be included.

## Uniqueness or Novelty 
### DIPS Simulator : 
Digital Image Processing Simulator is a software which can simulate the process of digital image processing. It has been developed in order to provide a platform for testing and evaluating the performance of algorithms for digital image processing.The simulator works on the image array and gives the results in the same format. The software simulates some common effects for digital images such as noise removal, edge preserving smoothing, and image enhancement.  
ImageProx is different from this as our software provides the real time image upload and output along with the backend code done for processing the image rather than taking up the image array using our website you can edit any image from your device irrespective of size or type.    
### GIMP:
GIMP is a free and open source image editor that can be used for editing, cropping, retouching, and more.GIMP is a free and open source image editor that can be used for editing, cropping, retouching, and more. It is often called the Photoshop of Linux because it has all the features of Photoshop but it is free to use. The tool provides the functionality of Image Processing.  
On the other hand, ImageProx also provides you with editing functionalities like image enhancement,editing, cropping but with a better and optimized way where you can get the knowledge of the code that has been implemented in the back end. Here you can learn Image Processing in an effective manner.   
### E-Learning for Digital Image Processing :
In this project, a website for learning digital image processing will be created. It will have a number of modules, and each module will have tests to see if the principles have been understood.The best way to comprehend the technology of digital image processing is to see it. This system's primary goal is to improve how users interpret digital image processing ideas. Different front-end and back-end technologies, as well as a database, were used to build this system.  
ImageProx is using similar functionalities but with a much more interactive manner.It also provides tools like blur and sharpen which help you highlight the main focus of your picture. It also has tools like noise reduction which helps you remove unwanted noise from your photos.The above mentioned software is only providing a platform to implement DIP ideas whereas ImageProx gives you a platform to learn Image Processing and it can also be used as a Data Augmentation tool.   

### Processing: 
A versatile software sketchbook and a coding language, Processing is used for learning. Processing has fostered visual literacy in technology and software literacy within the visual arts. Processing is used for learning and prototyping by students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists.It provides you with various video tutorials to learn Image processing.   
Our Project ImageProx is unlike any other website or course it provides you with learning experience.ImageProx is a one-stop solution for providing you with the majority of image processing methods you can use, apply, and carry out operations on. In addition to being a photo editor, this programme may also be used as a data augmentation tool, which can be utilized as preparation for machine learning algorithms.  

### Social Relevance

Digital technology has unshackled learning, providing learners with a wealth of opportunities to learn what they want to learn, how they want to learn, and where they want to learn with just a few clicks of the mouse.Training via online platforms is more effective than doing it with other means, it is easily understandable and interactive work to learn and grow.

ImagerProx is a one-stop solution that can be used as a Learning Platform, Photo Editor, and Data Augmentation Tool.
